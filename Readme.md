### Accident Severity Analysis and Prediction
#### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict the severity of traffic accidents using a comprehensive dataset. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and building machine learning models to classify accident severity levels. The project leverages various techniques, including association rule mining, outlier detection, and ensemble modeling, to extract valuable insights and develop an accurate prediction system.

#### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about traffic accidents in the United Kingdom, including details such as the number of vehicles involved, day of the week, road class, road type, speed limit, junction details, light and weather conditions, road surface conditions, urban/rural area, vehicle type, vehicle maneuver, driver age and gender, and accident severity levels.

#### Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main components:

Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning and transforming the raw data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between features and accident severity.

Feature Engineering: New features are created or existing features are transformed to improve the predictive power of the models.

Association Rule Mining: The Apriori algorithm is used to discover interesting associations between features and accident severity levels.

Outlier Detection: The Isolation Forest algorithm is employed to identify and analyze outliers or anomalies in the dataset, particularly based on geographical coordinates.

Model Building and Evaluation: Various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, KNN, SVM, and Stacked Models, are trained and evaluated using cross-validation techniques. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

Model Interpretation and Insights: The trained models are analyzed to understand feature importances and gain insights into the factors influencing accident severity.

Deployment: The best-performing model is deployed or integrated into a system for predicting accident severity levels based on new data.
